## C
# Low Level
Man, I am at Low Level Academy and our teacher(instructor) is really good, he teaches with jokes and fun. I really love his programs because he write them neatly easy to digest, and so nice when you get to the bottom of his code, Thanks to my teacher(instructor).

## Projects
# [main.c](https://github.com/imboowa/C/blob/main/main.c)
Well, I love writing to files because this is how I get to know file descriptors. File descriptors are these integer values assigned to any file given and used by the kernel to reference in execution. So if I write to `FD 0`, well I am writing to `STDIN`, then `FD 1` for `STDOUT`, then `FD 2` for `STDERROR`.

# [file.c](https://github.com/imboowa/C/blob/main/file.c)
This has the definitions needed at link time. The compiler needs the declarations at compile time. We use header files to by pass errors at compile time, errors like `"Where is foo()"` from the compiler. Then another C file to store our definitions so that the linker can link against the file with the function(functionality).

# [file.h](https://github.com/imboowa/C/blob/main/file.h)
This is the header file I am yapping about.

# [file_validator.c](https://github.com/imboowa/C/blob/main/help.c)
This makes a file, then validates its content with stat struct. So it basically `fstat(reads)` content form the file into a stat instance then we compare that data against that actual value we got from our struct as you will see in the code. Then we compare filesize. If not match, `"GO AWAY HACKER"`.

# [memory.c](https://github.com/imboowa/C/blob/main/lowlevel.c)
This is infact the most code snippet so nice that I really love it. This program does the realloc but explicit in a way that it calles realloc in itself, then reallocates memory to a given `(pointer, size)`. Thanks to my teacher(instructor), Ed.

# [game.c](https://github.com/imboowa/C/blob/main/home.c)
If C++ makes games can't C make games too. I really learnt this from a popular YouTuber, BroCode. He taught me function logic(DRY)`Don't Repeat Yourself`. This makes a board, you play, and it clears. That alone is logic. Coding is fun guys, try it.
